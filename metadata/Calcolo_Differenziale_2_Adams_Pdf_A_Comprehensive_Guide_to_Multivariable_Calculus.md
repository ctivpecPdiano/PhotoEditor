# Calcolo Differenziale 2 Adams Pdf: A Comprehensive Guide to Multivariable Calculus
 
Calculus is the branch of mathematics that studies the properties and behavior of functions, rates of change, limits, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. Calculus can be divided into two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus deals with finding the slope, tangent, or rate of change of a function at a given point. Integral calculus deals with finding the area, volume, or total change of a function over an interval.

Calculus can also be classified by the number of variables involved in the functions. Single-variable calculus studies functions of one variable, such as *f(x)*, while multivariable calculus studies functions of more than one variable, such as *f(x,y,z)*. Multivariable calculus extends the concepts and techniques of single-variable calculus to higher dimensions and more complex situations.
 
One of the most popular and widely used textbooks for multivariable calculus is **Calculus: A Complete Course** by Robert A. Adams and Christopher Essex. This book covers topics such as vectors and vector-valued functions, partial derivatives and multiple integrals, vector calculus, differential equations, and applications to physics, engineering, and economics. The book also provides numerous examples, exercises, and solutions to help students master the material.
 
However, the book is written in English and may not be accessible to students who speak other languages. Fortunately, there is a PDF version of the book that has been translated into Italian by Luigi Quartapelle. This PDF version is called **Calcolo Differenziale 2: Funzioni di PiÃ¹ Variabili** (Differential Calculus 2: Functions of More Variables). This PDF version can be downloaded from various online sources for free or for a small fee.

## Vectors and Vector-Valued Functions
 
A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. For example, the displacement, velocity, and force are vectors. Vectors can be represented by arrows or by ordered pairs or triples of numbers, such as *(x,y)* or *(x,y,z)*. These numbers are called the components of the vector and they indicate how much the vector moves along each coordinate axis.
 
A vector-valued function is a function that assigns a vector to each value of its independent variable. For example, the position, velocity, and acceleration of a moving object can be described by vector-valued functions. Vector-valued functions can be written as *r(t) = (f(t),g(t))* or *r(t) = (f(t),g(t),h(t))*, where *f*, *g*, and *h* are scalar functions of *t*.
 
Vectors and vector-valued functions can be used to model various phenomena in physics, engineering, and other fields. They can also be manipulated algebraically and geometrically using operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, cross product, length, angle, and curvature.

## Partial Derivatives and Multiple Integrals
 
A partial derivative is the derivative of a multivariable function with respect to one of its variables while keeping the other variables constant. For example, if *f(x,y)* is a function of two variables, then its partial derivatives are *f<sub>x</sub>(x,y) = df/dx* and *f<sub>y</sub>(x,y) = df/dy*. Partial derivatives can be used to measure the rate of change of a function along different directions or to find the slope or tangent plane of a function at a given point.
 
A multiple integral is an integral of a multivariable function over a region in two or more dimensions. For example, if *f(x,y)* is a function of two variables, then its double integral over a region *R* is *∫<sub>R</sub>f(x,y)dA*. Multiple integrals can be used to find the area, volume, mass, center of mass, or average value of a function over a region.
 
Partial derivatives and multiple integrals can be used to study various properties and applications of multivariable functions. They can also be generalized to higher-order derivatives and integrals using techniques such as the chain rule, the product rule, the quotient rule, integration by parts, integration by substitution, and change of variables.
